II Body 
    -A - Issues Involved 
      1. Constitutional questions Raised.
         a. not within the [providence?] of Jury to decide.

         (b) conflicts with bible story of creation.

      [Page 5]

III Conclusion
    A - Why you should convict Scopes.
      1. Because violated law of state
        (a) It is your duty to uphold state laws.
          (1) you are sworn to uphold the law.
          (b) you should be all the more stronger for upholding the laws of the state for there is an inclination by certain people to only obey the laws that they like and disobey the ones that they do not like.
            (1) look at Murray Butler.
            (2) Look at Roger Baldwin.
      
      [Page 7]      
            
      2 - Because Scopes is undermining the morals of our children by teaching them a doctrine that teaches every thin belief       in an established religion and gives them nothing in return.
      
      [Page 8]
      
      3 - Because Theories of evolution are unproven and are not reasonably substantiated by the very evidence on which they          are based.
        (a) no way to tell whether or not the argument of monkeys and man shows a cronological development. It is just as             reasonable to say that man appeared first and that the monkeys developed after and from [him?].(b)
        
      [Page 9]  
        
      4 Evolution has become a religious controversy and for this reason alone should not be taught in our public Schools.
        (a) Ministers of the church have been in disagreement for sometime.
        (b) Pennsylvania and other States have passed laws against reading & teaching the Bible in School, why not also               eliminate anti bible doctrine such as evolution?
