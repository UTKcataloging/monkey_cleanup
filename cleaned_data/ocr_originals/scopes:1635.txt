To Sue Hicks, Editor 
Chattanooga, Tenn. 

  Dear Publisher: Kindly inform me regarding that speech whether it is in print and where it will be available, Mr W.J. Bryan the great mans speech he wanted to deliver the closing hours of the Scopes case. 
  
  The sad news came unexpected, The Commoner has abundance of friends, because the Church loved him. He defended the faith, not the bible, which was delivered once to the saints and all Christians. Please let me hear from you and about the booklet that he had arranged to have printed at Chattanooga. 
  
  Yours truly,
  H.G. Wall
