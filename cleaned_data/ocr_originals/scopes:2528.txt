Mr Hicks & Hicks Dayton Tenn. 

Dear Sirs,The Scopes Case put me into an almost interminable research through the corrupt and dastardly books of Evolution. I have carried on the campaign through 3 near by newspapers. The N.Y. lawyers were right; evolution does raise a religious question, the same as Mormonism. But this defeats them; for as evolution goes back (as they claim) to the first cause, and in Tenn, the first violation of the Constitution came when evolution wa put into the schools, Have you made this point strong before your Supreme Court? Kindly let me hear from you(clipping enclosed) 

Yours Truly, 
Geo A Talley, 
Marcus Hook Pa.
