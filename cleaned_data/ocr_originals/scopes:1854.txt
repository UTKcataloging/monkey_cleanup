My Dear Sir,

We are so intensely interested in the coming trial. We live under the shadow of Vanderbilt and Peabody, and realize that the teaching of evolution is lowering moral standards and destroying the faith of the students not only in God but our govern-ment.

I am sending you a copy of Mr Edgerton's article and the poem of my own - am also sending a copy which can be sung to the old tune of "John Brown's Body lies a moulding in the Grave."

audiance if it will in the slightest aid you brave men in your fight for truth and right.

God grant you power and courage, for we mothers are praying for you. 

Sincerely,

Mrs. E.P. Blair.
