Dear Sir. 

    The enemies of religeon & intelecuals so called are certainly befoging the issue.Is it not a simple matter of controll over what shall be taught children: & who shall have the power to judge. The teacher or parents through the law makers.

    Free speach is not the issue, evolution & religeon is not the issue, to my mind. It is a socalistic move viz the teachers & others wish to remove the parents authority over their activities. They wish to be left alone to teach what they please.My wish is that your antievolution law will be sustained & parents thereby retain controlle over their children while in public schools.
    
    Very Truly,
    AS Krolz.
