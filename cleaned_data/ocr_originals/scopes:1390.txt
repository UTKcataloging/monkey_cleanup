P.O.Bx 1697 B'ham, Ala., June 7th 1925.My dear Sir, Friend and Brother Bryan:I rejoyce that you are in shape to take up the battle. I shall continue to pray for you. Will not bother you, but I thot that perhaps you might have time to look over the enclosed, before the start. G.B.F. Stovall (see clipping), is the guy whom the News, let "challenge" you to-debate (sic) while you were here, giving your great lecture in Dr. Stuart's 1st M. E. Church, South. This Stovall - will show up there and we'll get "Evolution=hash," in the News, I will not waste time on it. He is jealous at you and News hate you with a perfect hate. You'll see a poor insicknificant dried up stick. He's a luny - and fit for an - sanatorium. You can see he is not satisfied with himself nor anybody. You''ll see him. God bless you, and take care of you! Yours truly in The Lord. JP Holm
