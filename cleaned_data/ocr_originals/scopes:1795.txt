Pittsburgh July  8th

To Judge John T. Raulston,
Mr. H.E. Hicks. 

    Dear Sir: - 
    
    I am desirous to write to you and the other gentleman participating in Mr. John T. Scope's trial, in regards to belief in Evolution: - and wish to state that, if the human race has originated, or, evolved from either a chimpanzee; gorilla or monkey; - then, if so, wouldn't
    
    [Page 2]
    
    there be a decided, or discernable change in the general physical features of one, or more Monkeys of their different species. That is, for them to be, or some of them gradually becoming; even (since only two or three hundred years ago), more like a human being. I think this is a very reasonable cause, to justify an opposition to such a definate belief.
    
    [Page 3]
    
    Again, if the human Race have been evolved from the Monkey, - then we must believe there was one or more black, brown and red Monkeys to cause the differ ent colors of the human Race: - also, a yellow Monkey; don't you think so?Therefore, if evolution of some things is true; then, apparently, I think it very reasonable to disbelieve the theory

of the evolution of the Monkey, unless it can be proved.

Yours Respectfully,
Henry Fuller,(Violinist,)
N.S. Pittsburgh Pa. 

P.S. Will state that, after addressing this letter to Judge Raulston, I changed my mind, and addressed it to you. But, if you care to request Judge, J. T. Raulston to read it, you may, of course, decide to do so.

P.S. I think, Mr. Hicks, that one fact alone seems to prove that human beings have not desended from the Monkey: - : - which is, in consideration of Feminine facial beauty, and Form; - even so, , to go back far into the time of The (Bible), , (Old Testament.)
