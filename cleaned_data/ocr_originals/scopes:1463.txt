Dear Col. Hicks,

    I took an active part in the passage of the anti-evolution bill. I am still interested. The Methodist preacher here at Mad- and myself are planing to come over to Dayton on July 10th - start from here early on the morning of the 10th - to be at the "monkey trial." At what hour will the trial begin? Can you arrange for us to have a seat up right close to the "show"? I want to see the "monkey". I wish I was a lawyer and could heave 30 min. to skin those decendents of the beasts of the forest. God's children cannot be dabsed with the brute around where I stay. Please write me,
    Yours,
    R.L. Boyd
