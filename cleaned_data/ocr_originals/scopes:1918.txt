Gentlemen,

I have been intensely interested in the great battle so nobly fought by W.J. Bryan. I read in Illustrated Daily News of Los Angeles Calif that you & 2 others will carry on the battle, and I shall pray for your success.

I read in the News that Mr Bryan stated that Darwin died an atheist; I know he Mr Bryan was truthful, so he must have been misinformed, and I thought to send him this clipping which I now forward to you. I have taken the paper it is cut from for years, & believe it 

[Page 2]

is thoroughly reliable, and is used of God. 

Lady Hope, the writer is well known in England & America, as a lovely Christian character.

It saddens me to know that the Bible which I have loved and read (since I was five years old, in 1855) has been taken out of the schools; and now we have to keep pay teachers, whose teaching may render of none effect what the children learn of the Bible in their homes or Sunday Schools

Yours sincerely, 

M.W. Lusk.
