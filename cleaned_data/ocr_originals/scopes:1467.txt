San Antonio Texas1930 W. Ashby Place June 26 - 25.Hon. Wm J. Bryan,Dayton, Tenn. My Dear Sir: I am enclosing herewith a copy of a criticism of "Well's Outline of History" written by myself, and published in two of our leading church periodicals. Also a brief review of a new work on geology I am sending this matter with the hope and prayer that it may be of some small service to you and your associates in the pending evolution trial. Praying that you may have Divine guidance, and truth and righteousness and may triumph over human conceit and error, I am,Yours Most Cordially,(Rev.) John G. Pollard.
