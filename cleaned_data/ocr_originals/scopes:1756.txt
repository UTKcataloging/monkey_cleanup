July 6th 1925. 
Winchester Virginia. 
Prosecuting Attorney of Rhea County. 

    My Dear Sir: -
    
    We Virginians expect you will in this trial decide just how far Evolution can be taught in the schools of Tennessee. These retired politicians & criminal lawyers may Evolute just so far as they leave all connection between a man with a soul and the monkey without a soul - The Christians of the world do not expect agnostics and so-call scientist to put their construction on the Bible, and try in any way teach doctrines which our blessed Lord never taught.
    
    I am sure that it will be clearly set forth in this trial just how far evolution must be taught.
    Yours Sincerely, Alexander Spotswood Dandridge (Civil Engineer). 
    
    P.S. I do not know just now the name of gentleman who will represent the prosecuting attorney in this case
