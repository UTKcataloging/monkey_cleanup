[note: postscript is written vertically up the left side of the page]Winchester Virginia,June 28th 1925. Prosecuting Attorney Dayton Tennessee,My Dear Sir If those so-called scientific agnostics from [stricken: Chicago?] the East and The West want to air their [Atheistic?] doctorine to the extent that the animal (Monkey) had any origin or connection in the creation of man then invite them to leave Tennessee.[stricken: God will] Tennesseans look to their Creator & Merciful Redeemer not to these so-called scientific [tramps?].God created man in His own image - here is where the real man-looking monkey (the Ape) came from - some South Asiatic or African man eater or cannable married a she monkey even without a dog [license?] and produced the ape. If a man is born with only one leg or 5 legs this is a freak of Nature, caused by the sin of man on his children. Evolution is Hellward - [illegible] man going into the beast. Evolution is confined  within the developement of its Kind- we reap the seed we sow.Yours sincerely, Alexander Spotswood Dandridge civic Engineer.P.S. You have a Governor of the right ring. he had within him the right proper spirit when he says this Nation [wants?] to the God & this school. 3 cheers for Governor Austin Peay.
