Dayton Tenn,
    Gentlemen, I cannot understand I have not even received my m.ss. let alone otherwise hearing from you. I am very much worried over the thoughts of loosing my m.ss. Am having one of the [of]ficers in the Sheridan Bank and Trust co. get in touch with some one of the Bank in Dayton, to see if they can learn what is the cause of the trouble which is causing me anxiety I do not wish to be worried while I am in such a deep study besides there are other prospects waiting an oppurtunity to review my work. I am getting along fine with my present [e?]ddition. I trusted you people explicitly and still feel the same, however should any thing be wrong, it will all come out.  I can tell you, that any one that tries to get my work away from me, will have to continue it and also show the original work before it was type written. And I have every page, of the work besides a carbon copy, which has been reviewed by several who have given me much praise. Trusting you will have your Typist drop me a line. enclosed an address previously for you to send me m.s.. dont forget.
    
    Respectfully Yours, 
    S.L. Walters.
