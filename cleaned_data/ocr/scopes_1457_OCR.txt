I sincerely hope it may be a benefit to you. could I have a talk with you or any one interested in the work it would then be more convincing to any one who is not acquainted with my theory I cannot help what all these great.heads are trying to do they are in the wrong. and I wish to say to you if there is any-thing in my work that you can use. use it to your utmost ability. only do not use the name of Walters as I do not want to become known untill after my Book is published: ;Therefore; I am to be known as Miss. McKillican. during the trial. neither do I wish it known that I am in Chicago. am only here temporarily, and could not do any writing or research work while I would be under any strain as publicity would place me in. Therefore: protect me all you can. should you need me. let me know as early as you can. wishing you all the success you will have. I still feel that your side is going to win out.Respectfully Yours,S.L. Walters.
