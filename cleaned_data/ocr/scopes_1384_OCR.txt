4806 Allemania St.,St. Louis, Mo.June 8, 1925. Messrs. S.K. & H.E. Hicks,Dayton, Tenn. Gentlemen: I am very much interested in the result of the case on the teaching of Evolu-tion in your state, of which you are the prosecutors. I want you to win that case, and therefore I inclose a small pamphlet which, I think, contains all the facts and evi-dence necessary to do it. The other side has no facts: only theories and opinions. This the pamphlet clearly proves. If you do not need it, please return it at once. I inclose the necessary postage.Respectfully yours,B.J. Specking
