Kansas City, Mo. July 15th 1925.Mr. Supt. of schools, Dayton, Tenn. Somebody told me that Mr Scopes, who is tried at Dayton for teaching evolution, is going to marry a champanzee, and Mr Darrow the lawyer is going to perform the marriage cermony. Is all this true?The [parties?] read this in a paper, said Mr Darrow wants Mr Scopes to raise children by the monkey tribe and show the church people that man came from the monkey's. This fellow said that the chimpanzee was at Dayton, and all was to take place at or in front of the court house. Please let me know when it takes place, as I want to know if a man and chimpanzee can have children. Yours Respectfully,Otto Weber 1630 Genseee St.
