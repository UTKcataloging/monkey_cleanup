   <note displayLabel="Transcription">1.On the second of August, &apos;24 it was my privilege, through the kindness of Mr. Money-penny, Warden of the Cook Co. jail, to interview the daring criminals, Leopold and Loeb, on their religious be-liefs; and particularly with reference to the relation of the doctrine of evolution as taught in Chicago University, and their [consequent?] philosophy of life. Most of the answers to my questions were given by Leopold, Loeb nodding affirmation to his pals view when I repeated what Leopold had said, in answer to my questions. (2.) After the preliminaries of explanation as to the occasion of my visit, I said, &quot;Do you believe in evolution?&quot; He replied, &quot;I most certainly do; all sane people believe in evolution.&quot; [note: some of the following was later underlined.] &quot;What theory of evolution do you hold?&quot; He said, &quot;I believe in Orthogenesis.&quot; &quot;And what is your conception of Orthogenesis?&quot;&quot;Well, it is the very latest theory of evolution - later than the Darwin[illegible], Lamarckian or the Freudian.&quot;&quot;Is there any room for God in your theory?&quot;&quot;Absolutely no,&quot; he said with emphasis, quickly adding, &quot;You must be a follower of (3.)William Jennings Bryan&quot;. I replied - [stricken: &quot;I did] &quot;I do not claim to be a follower of any one but the Lord Jesus Christ, and a very poor one at that, but as between Mr. Bryan and his critics my sympathies are de-cidedly with Mr. Bryan.&quot; He grew quite animated at once and scoffed back: &quot;Well pardon me for insult-ing a friend, but I think William Jennings Bryan is the biggest fool ever turned loose in America on the evolutionary question.&quot; I then utilized my remaining lim-ited time by expressing my profound conviction (4.)that the sad predicament in which he found him-self was the direct [fruit?], of which his evolutionary beliefs were the root, and submitted to their consider-ation the little book en-titled &quot;The reason why&quot; which both boys promised me faithfully they would read. That afternoon while some students from Michigan and Chicago Universities where testifying, an inter-ested listener who sat be-side me behind Judge Caverly&apos;s desk, as he had kindly invited us to seat there where we could hear [more?] readily, remarked to me(5.) that he had taught Loeb in the department of Psychol-ogy, in which he served as an Assistant Professor. I then expressed to him my delight of the privilege of meeting him, recounted my conversation with the boys as recorded a-bove, and asked if they had correctly reported that teaching of the University. He replied that they had, and I further asked if in his judgment there views were shared by the teachers of science in the University and he as-sured me they were, and also shared by himself.(6.)Amongst the details of my questioning of Leo-pold that I recall, was the question whether he considered we are direct descendants from mon-keys; he replied &quot;oh no, that is not scientific; the correct and latest sci-entific view is that both man and monkey are descended from the same source which is now be-ing sought and commonly known as the &quot;missing link&quot;. I further asked &quot;what then he considered [our?] relation-[illegible: shi?]p to the monkey to be?&quot; He replied &quot;I would say we are distant cousins.&quot; I repeated this to the [stricken: C of] U of C Professor(7.)and asked if the young men were scientifically ac-curate in this view and he said &quot;quite so&quot;, but added that he wouldn&apos;t say Mr. L. was correct in say-ing Orthogenesis was the very latest evolutionary theory and left me with the impression that the whole question is in such a nebulous state from the scientific standpoint that no man could claim the right to state dog-matically that any par-ticular theory is &quot;the very latest.&quot;</note>
